# Computilers
This repository is created for compiler design course in 1400-2 semester.
we used PLY and yacc library for first two phases of project (tokenizing and parsing) but because of PLY problem with creating AST as an output of parsing we switched all the project to lark library. the third phase which was adding code generator to the project is specified for lark library.

we design a little and simple compiler for Decaf programming language with python and its special libraries for compiling and tokenizing.
